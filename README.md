# Transparent-and-Traceable-Food-Supply-Chain-Management
This repository contains the proposed solution to track the complete path of a product in the food supply chain, providing improved quality assessment, transparency, traceability, and fraud detection capabilities. The project was developed as part of a course on blockchain technology.


## Motivation
The Indian agricultural sector faces various challenges, including fragmented supply chains, inadequate cold chain infrastructure, poor packaging, inefficient traders, and a lack of organized logistics, resulting in inefficiencies and losses. These challenges, along with the absence of technology and a manual labor system, lead to an increase in lead time and costs for importing goods. Furthermore, the lack of compliance and traceability in traditional buying routes causes a growing lack of trust in the sourcing of produce sold in markets. This project's motivation is to explore the potential of blockchain technology in the agricultural sector to improve traceability, sustainability, and transparency while streamlining cooperative operations, benefiting both farmers and consumers.


## Abstract
The food supply chain has a number of challenges, including a lack of transparency and disengagement among stakeholders. By providing a transparent and traceable digital ledger of transactions and movements for all supply chain actors, blockchain technology can provide a resolution to these problems. We propose a blockchain-based system for tracking a product's full path, from its raw components to the finished item in the store. Many advantages of the offered system include improved
quality assessment, increased product transparency and traceability, and sophisticated fraud detection capabilities. By reinventing the way transactions are carried out and enabling stakeholders to obtain a complete record of each product's journey, the system has the potential to completely alter the food supply chain. Also, by minimising inefficiencies, waste, and fraudulent activities that have a negative influence on the supply chain, the deployment of this system can remove limits imposed by the current supply chain. Overall, the suggested blockchain-based system has the potential to significantly increase the efficiency, transparency, and traceability of the food supply chain.


## Feasibilty
To make this idea a feasible solution, it requires immense government support and a heavy capital investment to set up the entire ecosystem. From a technical viewpoint, the project is feasible. But some obstacles which we can face in this are the blockchain might get overloaded with data because as the package travels, at every point the data is being fed into the blockchain. From an economical viewpoint, this is going to be expensive to set up but considering that government will invest and support in this project, it is an idea which can be implemented. Another problem which we can encounter is that it is hard to convince people at first because blockchain is very new. India has come a long way in the last decade in terms of food traceability, thanks to private and public sector initiatives.

Food traceability, once implemented across supply chains, will have the following effects on our supply chains:
- Meet consumer demand for transparency in food production.
- Improve your ability to recognise, respond to, and even prevent food safety issues.
- Help to optimise the supply chain and reduce food waste
- Validate sourcing claims to achieve sustainability goals.


## Conclusion
The food supply chain can be revolutionized by a blockchain-based system by increasing efficiency, transparency, and traceability, which will have a favorable
effect on public health, the environment, and the economy. Each stage of the supply chain may be tracked by the system, allowing early detection of potential quality problems, preventing foodborne diseases, decreasing food waste, and informing consumers about the country of origin of their food. Additionally, the use of a blockchain-based system can aid in the prevention of fraudulent activities like forging, mislabeling, and tampering by spotting any discrepancies in
the supply chain and enabling quick remedial action. This project has a bright future ahead of it, with a wide range of opportunities for growth and collaboration with other new technologies, governmental organizations, and international marketplaces that will result in a more ethical and sustainable global supply chain. Ultimately, a blockchainbased system for the food supply chain might be advantageous to all parties and help it become more efficient, transparent, and sustainable.
